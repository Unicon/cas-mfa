# Readme for webapp-overlay-example

## What is this?

This is intended to be an *example* of a local CAS implementation Maven overlay that incorporates the Java and Web components in this project to deliver a working example of a local CAS implementation making use of the additional multi-factor authentication capabilities.

## How do I build it?

*Good question*.  To be defined and documented.

Presumably, you `mvn package` just as you normally would in the Maven overlay approach, and then deploy the resulting `.war` file.
