# Readme for cas-mfa-web

## What is this

This is the multifactor extensions for CAS sub-module for Web components.  Things that are not Java, that do not build into a .jar.  

For example: JSPs, deployment descriptors, customized and new Spring Web Flow XML and other Spring web framework configuration, etc.

These components depend on the Java in the .jar built by the parallel `cas-mfa-java` module.

## How do I build this

*Good question*.  To be defined and documented.
